# Forkify



10/1/2020

This is a project by Jonas Schmedtman on his Javascript Udemy course. I'm going over it to cement my understanding of certain topics, in particular Webpack and MVC (without a library) architecture.

This readme is a log of the work I'm doing on the project. I'm aiming to work on projects on my Saturdays, while the rest of my time is spent on interview preparation (I'm currently interviewing for roles in London).
